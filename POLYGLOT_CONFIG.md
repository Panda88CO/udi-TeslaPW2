# teslaPW

## Installation
For local access to PowerWall the local IP address (LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS) along with login  (LOCAL_USER_EMAIL) and password (LOCAL_USER_PASSWORD) must be added in configuration

It may be necesary to power cycle (turn power wall on and off using the switch on the local power wall) - 

Cloud access is now accessible through the node server directly by clicking authentication button (after config).  The login will appear similar to the tesla website.  User must grant node server access to data.  The following scopes are used granted access:

energy_device_data 
energy_cmds 
open_id 
offline_access

Once installed a status node for each EV registered in the user account is created with sub-nodes for each EV addressing charging and climate control.

If additional functionality is desired contact the author through github - https://github.com/Panda88CO/udi-TeslaPW
